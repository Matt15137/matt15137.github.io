## About
My name is Matthew Latondresse and I learned from a really young age that I had a lot of questions about how things work. This led me down a very interesting path into the field and study of psychology to better understand how people can become the person they are. This eventually led me into a unique position where I got a job for Rhode Islands National Suicide Life Line. Eventually a new federal initiative was passed to put the National Suicide Lifeline on par with 911. Thus 988 was born. With this major step forward the team needed to expand and I was promoted to be one of the Clinical Supervisors. As I worked with this development I worked closely with the Data team and soon discovered a passion for Data Analysis. This led me to changing careers to a company where I could better put my skills to use. With the completion of my Master's Degree soon and demonstration of my abilities I was promoted to Business Development Analytics.
